  ## Evolution of Cultural Complexity III
  Day TBA 
  Thessaloniki, Greece 

---

### Scientific Background

Human sociocultural evolution has been documented throughout the history
of humans and earlier hominins. This evolution manifests itself through
development from tools as simple as a rock used to break nuts, to something as
complex as a spaceship able to land man on other planets. Equally, we
have witnessed evolution of human population towards complex multilevel
social organisation.

Although cases of decrease and loss of this type of complexity have
been reported, in global terms it tends to increase with time. Despite
its significance, the conditions and the factors driving this increase
are still poorly understood and subject to debate. Different hypothesis
trying to explain the rise of sociocultural complexity in human
societies have been proposed (demographic factor, cognitive component,
historical contingency...) but so far no consensus has been reached.

Here we raise a number of questions:

1.  Can we better define sociocultural complexity and confirm its
    general tendency to increase over the course of human history?
2.  What are the main factors enablingan increase of cultural
    complexity?
3.  Are there reliable way to measure the complexity in material culture
    and social organisationconstructs, that is?
4.  How can we quantify and compare the impact of different factors?
5.  What causes a loss of cultural complexity in a society? And how
    often these losses occurred in the past?

### Goals of the session

In this satellite meeting we want to bring together a community of
researchers coming from different scientific domains and interested in
different aspect of the evolution of social and cultural complexity.
From archaeologists, to linguists, social scientists, historians and
artificial intelligence specialists - the topic of sociocultural
complexity transgresses traditional discipline boundaries. We want to
establish and promote a constructive dialogue incorporating different
perspectives: theoretical as well as empirical approaches, research
based on historical and archaeological sources, as well as actual
evidences and contemporary theories. We are particularly interested in
formal approaches which enable more constructive theory building and
hypothesis testing. However, even establishing common vocabulary of
terms and concepts and discussing the main methodological challenges in
studying sociocultural complexity is an important step towards a more
cohesive framework for the understanding of cultural evolution in
general and for individual research case studies in particular. Our
approach is informed by the convergence between simulation and formal
methods in archaeological studies and recent developments in complex
systems science and complex network analysis.

The session will focus but is not limited to:
-   Social dynamics of innovation.
-   Cumulative Culture and social learning.
-   Evolution of Technology and technological changes
-   Cognitive Process,Creativity, cooperation and innovation
-   Population Dynamics and Demographic Studies
-   Computer tools to understand the cultural evolutionary change
