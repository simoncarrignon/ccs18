From a global perspective the sociocultural evolution of humans has been
a strong driving force throughout our shared history. From the invention
of tools as simple as a knapped pebble to the development of complex
machines able to land men on the Moon, humans as a species have been
developing, advancing and perfecting objects and techniques we use in
our daily lives. Equally, we have witnessed a slow but steady shift
among human groups towards more complex multilevel social organisations.

Although never a case of continuous progress but rather an ebb and flow
peppered with sudden surges in pace and dramatic collapses, the global
trend can be characterised as an increase in cultural and social
complexity over time. Despite its significance, the mechanisms and the
factors driving this process are still poorly understood and subject to
debate. What drives society to continuously update and elaborate their
products? Why certain forms of social organisation seem to be more
stable than others? What factors cause a sudden loss in cultural
complexity? Different hypotheses trying to explain the rise of
sociocultural complexity across human societies have been proposed, from
demographic factor, cognitive component to historical contingency, but
we are far from reaching a consensus.

This special issue follows on from the session **“Evolution of Cultural
Complexity”** held at the _Conference on Complex System 2017_, where those
questions were discussed. However we also welcome submissions from
authors who did not present. The submission can be of any of the types:
original research article, review of the literature on the topic of the
session, short communication and opinion (_cf._ the submission guideline
of Adaptive Behavior for more information on these formats:
[*https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/journal/adaptive-behavior\#submission-guidelines*](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/journal/adaptive-behavior#submission-guidelines)).
We invite studies related to the evolution of cultural complexity,
including but not limited to the following topics:

-   Definition, proxies and quantification of cultural complexity
-   Cultural transmission, cumulative culture and social learning
-   Evolution of technology and technological change
-   Social dynamics of innovation and cooperation
-   Cognitive basis of creativity, cooperation and innovation
-   Interactions between cultural complexity and population dynamics
-   Methods and tools to study cultural complexity and evolutionary
    change

The submission will proceed through the SAGE journal submission system:

During the submission process please select the article type: “**Special
issue on the evolution of cultural complexity**”.

Please also note that submissions have to follow SAGE submission
guidelines:
